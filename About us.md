![Hello!](img/beh2.jpg)

Teacher Colin is a former research professor. He studied at the University of Cambridge and Leeds University, and worked at the University of Oxford, the Universit√© de Rennes (France), and Columbia University in New York City, with study visits to CNR/IRPI Perugia, National Taiwan University (Taipei), and the University of Tokyo.

This is not a photo of him. He is a rather older than that.
